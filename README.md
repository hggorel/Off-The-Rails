>side scroller with platformer aspects 
this is present and looks good
>keybound player movements 
this is present and works well. On the first level of the game we should give the player instructions on which keys tie to which actions (z may not be the obvious shooting mechanic to someone)
>action movie style gravity 
it is very action movie style
>brief enemy battles
there are fights with enemies. For a first level, I think this is very nice

### notes

-speed is unsatisfying-controls feels laggy, but it works well
-animation, obviously, needs to be implemented (that will be for playtest 1, in a few weeks)
-game over screen is satisfying
-on game over screens, i could make sprites/ figure out the pngs as string trick to make them more visually interesting (or make the pngs and someone else could figure that out : ( we'll see sorry)

*bugs found*
there is a bug where Mable can get stuck jumping up from the sunken exit area could be a collission or gravity issue?

I'll add the screenshots here, later
-if Mable gets shot while jumping/ facing left, sometimes she will get shot off the screen (below the floor). I did not get a screenshot of this. I have no idea what could cause this
-I'm guessing it is also a collision issue, where because of theshot pushing Mable back, it also pushes her down slightly (sometimes), then the collission stops checking beneath her.

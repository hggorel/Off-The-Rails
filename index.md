## Game Description 

What was supposed to be an easy escape becomes a wild ride. Your escape on the passenger train, Twm Siôn Cati, gains a following. Try to escape with your loot--the Queen of England’s crown-- all the way up to the locomotive to ensure your escape. In this exciting platformer, possibly reminiscent of Mario and Indiana Jones, you will run and shoot to progress through the train using 3 distinct weapons.  Each train car you enter holds unique challenges and enemies that must be defeated in order to pass through, but be careful, you need to act fast in order to stay ahead of the Queen's guards pursuing you! Solve puzzles, shoot enemies, fight off the guards, and escape to the locomotive, or else you'll be thrown in the Tower!

Off the Rails is a nostalgic return to platformers and playing games on Newgrounds with your friends--without having too much nostalgia for all the problems that existed in 1960’s Britain. Let’s be honest, though: who hasn’t wanted to steal the Queen’s crown? In classic Arsene Lupin style, this game is a bit of an extension of that fantasy with hijinks, fast action, and train excitement (for the untapped market of the train fan).

## Background
Set in early 1960s England, our heroine struggles through her life along with the rest of the low-middle class families in North England. She lives in a coal town, similar to most others in the North, and she sees firsthand the horrors of working in the mineshafts. Children never making it out of the tunnels, the terrifying collapses, and the black lung tearing through their working men was driving the town closer to a revolt everyday. The miner’s workers movements in England are just starting to rise up, and Mabel Brown has to do her part. Unfortunately, Mabel cannot be working with them as closely as she’d like: she’s awkward, out of place in a strike, and her enthusiasm makes everyone think she’s a union busting spy. Living in basic poverty while the high class and royals thrive without a care in the world, refusing to give up even scraps of their excessive wealth for the good of others, Mabel has had enough and decides to push back in her own way against their exuberant neglect. She embarks on a dangerous journey to steal the Queen of England’s crown, both a symbolic strike against the crown—and all it stands for—and a Robin Hood-esque move of stealing from the rich to give to the poor. The crown has millions of pounds worth of jewels embedded in it, enough to save Mabel’s hamlet and many more from their starvation.  

As Mabel makes her great escape to the passenger train Twm Siôn Cati, several enemies pursue her attempting to recover the crown. The train should take her from the depths of London, to the outskirts of Cardiff; once she’s in Wales getting to Ireland, and then the rest of the world, should be nothing hard. The Queensguard will first pursue Mabel from the outset, being her most distinctive enemy. But as she succeeds, more difficult and quirky enemies will begin to pursue her, including military men, the Great Wizard Merlin, Herlock Sholmes, and Bames Jond (alongside the standard passengers you’d see on a train, who must be having the most awful day to still be stuck on these rails). Luckily, Mabel can fight back; she’s procured an old gun, and she’ll be able to pick up some ammo along the way. If she can just make it past these foes, she can complete the final step of her great heist: stealing the locomotive to get right out of England. Or else, England hasn’t yet abolished capital punishment.
